<h1>hello gamers</h1>
  <h2>welcome to shradigames</h2>
    <p>this is a website where i hold all the games i've made, most of them in scratch.
    you should be able to play them all. no, the website is not very pretty. i don't
    have the energy to do very much CSS, if any at all.</p>
    <p>sooo uhh this is just the home menu, there ain't anything on this page. but there
    are a few other pages, like</p>
     <ul>
      <li><a href="mygames.html">My Own Games and Projects</a></li>
      <li>Not My Games, But I Think They Are Cool</li>
      <li>My Stories</li>
     </ul>
